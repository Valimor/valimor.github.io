# Welcome to *Deep Dive*

In these posts I am going to write about whatever hyperfixation I have been researching recently. These will vary from topic to topic, but I want to document the topics I find interesting in a manner that I find digestible and should be relatively intuitive for the average reader with a bit of mathematical experience.

I tend to approach most of these problems from a mathematical lens, so I will make sure that anything I dive into will be presented with most of the required context. Much like any piece of research there will be prerequisite understanding, but I hope that it will not be very big of an obstacle.
