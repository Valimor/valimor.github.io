I am a nuclear engineer with research interests all across the field of Applied Math, including:
- Active Learning
- Numerical Linear Algebra
- Statistics
- Deep Learning
- Computer Graphics

I plan on posting about whatever deep dives I have been going on recently, along with whatever research I have been doing.
